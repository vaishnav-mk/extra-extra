If Virat Kohli has decided to sit back home because he wants to be with his wife, if he's going to have his second child, I don't see any problem with that.

Last month, Kohli, initially part of India's three-T20I squad against Afghanistan, was again not available for the series opener – the development confirmed to the public on the eve of the match. Prior to it, Kohli had not featured for India in over a month, being rested for the Australia T20Is and the limited-overs led of the South African tour. He made his much-awaited comeback in the two-Test series against the Proteas, looking like a billion dollars and was set to face England before emergency hit. Ever since, it's been all quiet - a report in between stated that Kohli isn't even in the country, apparently London. But in the early hours of Saturday, the BCCI put all the rumours to rest when it announced India's squad for the Rajkot, Ranchi and Dharamsala Tests, and stated 'Virat Kohli will remain unavailable for selection for the remainder of the series due to personal reasons'.\n\n'In such times, cricket doesn't matter'\n\nAt first, Steyn wasn't aware of his former South Africa teammate De Villiers' U-turn, but when he did, the pacer decided not to address him and instead channelled his focus on Kohli. Steyn, de Villiers and Kohli share a close bond – Virat and ABD being as close as brothers. The trio were teammates at the Royal Challengers Bangalore, sharing the locker room for two seasons, which further solidified their bond, and in these testing times, Steyn stands behind Kohli like a rock.\n\n\"I think at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter about cricket. What matters is why you're playing and who helped you get there. The people behind you or behind the scenes, are the ones the public doesn't see. Your partner, your mother, your wife, your sister… those are the people that are constantly picking you up and if it means that their health is in jeopardy or something is wrong with them, you go to them and that's the most important thing,\" pointed out Steyn.\n\nFor those questioning Kohli's decisions and hurling baseless allegations under the guise of 'national duty' – and no true Viratian claiming to be his fan would go to such lengths – the message cannot be more crystal clear. It's none of your business. If cricket is being introduced at the Olympics because of Kohli, that's a national duty he has served. If the ICC Cricketer of the Decade has belonged to Kohli, that's a national duty he has served. If at 30, Kohli was already called a legend, that… is a national duty. And if because of him, more youngsters are finding their calling in cricket around the world, that… is national duty.\n\nKohli is India's icon, but that doesn't mean you're allowed to dissect his life."

He really is in the making. I will remember his spell,\" he said during commentary in the U19 World Cup semi-final between Pakistan and Australia. What makes the 15-year-old Pakistan pacer's performance even more special is that it did not come in a winning cause and yet was worth remembering. Yes, Australia edged out Pakistan by one wicket in an edge-of-the-seat thriller but it was Raza who made a name for himself. Ali Raza celebrates(ICC)\n\nHarry Dixon and Sam Konstas got Australia off to a slow, steady start chasing a paltry 180 but Pakistan made a roaring comeback after the Powerplay overs.\n\nDiscover the thrill of cricket like never before, exclusively on HT. Explore now!\n\nAnd it was Raza who started it all. He cleaned up Konstas with a delivery that nipped back in sharply to hit the stumps. Weibgen smashed a full toss straight to short cover off Naveed Khan to depart for four and a massive mix-up between Harjas Singh and Dixon saw the end of the former.\n\nWith three wickets falling quickly, Baig turned to strike bowler Ubaid Shah and the move worked. The dangerous Ryan Hicks was bowled off an inside edge for a golden duck as Australia slipped to a tense 59 for four.\n\nDixon was joined by the left-handed Ollie Peake, who has had to bat only two times in the competition before this. The two left-handers went about rebuilding the innings as Pakistan looked to attack further.\n\nDixon completed his half-century in the 24th over as Peake settled in at the other end. Minhas’ entry into the attack saw the back of Dixon. The left-arm spinner had the well-set Dixon cleaned up for 50 with a delivery that turned massively back into the batter.\n\nRuns dried up as Minhas and Naveed Khan kept things pretty tight. Raza returned to the attack after Naveed was bowled out and almost instantly found a wicket. Tom Campbell’s edge was found but the ball raced over the keeper for a boundary, the first for Australia in nine overs.\n\nMinhas, meanwhile, continued to bowl unchanged from his end and in his eighth over, the left-arm spinner struck again. Campbell was undone by an arm ball that skidded on with the angle and hit the stumps.\n\nWith another threatening stand broken, Pakistan were back into the contest. Australia were still 34 runs away with four wickets left in the bank. Raza found MacMillan’s edge the very next over with the slip fielder diving to take a catch close to the ground. But confirmation for a clean catch wasn't needed as the ball was over waist height and hence a no-ball.\n\nPeake continued to build, unflustered by the chaos around him, but while on 49, he nicked a harmless Raza delivery, going down the leg-side, through to the wicketkeeper to leave Australia in a tricky position. They were still 25 runs away and Pakistan sensed a way back to win the contest.\n\nRaza added two more in his final over to put Pakistan on the brink of a sensational win, sending back Staker and Beardman to reduce Australia to nine down.\n\nMacMillan continued to fight though and got a lucky top edge over the keeper's head for four in the 48th over with Australia needing less than 10 runs.\n\nUbaid Shah almost trapped the lower-order batsman in front in the following over, but the umpire dismissed the appeal, judging the ball to be sliding down the leg-side. Vidler then played out the remaining deliveries, reducing the equation to just three runs needed off the last over.\n\nIn a nerve-wracking climax, on the first ball of the final over, MacMillan, who looked to punch off his back foot, got an inside edge and the ball raced through fine leg, securing Australia's thrilling victory.\n\nRaza hails from Sheikhupura, a city in Pakistan's Punjab province. The youngster was first spotted by Pakistan U-19 assistant batting coach, Muhammad Masroor when he was 12.\n\n“Raza is a future prospect,” Masroor told The Indian Express. “He hails from Nankana Sahib in Sheikhpura. He has played most of his cricket in the village. He hates going to the gym. He just loves bowling in the nets; you have to literally pull him out. That part of Pakistan has always produced good pacers such as Mohammed Asif, Aaqib Javed, and Rana Naved-ul-Hasan. All three were masters of their craft,” said Masroor.\n\n“We were playing a three-day game at the Rana Naved Cricket Academy. In the morning, I saw a young boy wipe and clean the nets with the broom, and bowl for two hours on the trot. During lunch, he rested for an hour and started bowling again. He is that lambi race ka ghoda (in for a long haul). He knows how to bowl long spells that you don’t see in the current pacers. He is not a T20 bowler,” Masroor said.\n\nWith 4/34 in the semi-final, Raza proved Masroor right. But the latter feels the youngster needs to be looked after for him to have a bright future.\n\n“Sadly, we don’t have that system for the fast bowlers. We don’t have a proper rehab system. We don’t have good bowling coaches. The biomechanics labs are also not working. Raza indeed is a future superstar, but we all have to take care of him like our own kids.”"

Virat Kohli will not play any part in the Test series against England, and Dale Steyn, one of his fiercest rivals on the field, has backed and respected the star India cricketer's decision to be with family. Kohli, expected to miss only the first two Tests, is now out of it entirely, leading to nationwide speculation. After brother Vikas quashed 'false news' around his mother's health being the reason behind Kohli's absence, AB de Villiers' revelation that Kohli was expecting his second child seemed to have answered the burning question. However, with de Villiers retracting yesterday, the suspense meter stands raging hot. On Virat Kohli's absence, Dale Steyn says 'nothing comes above family' (PTI-Getty)\n\nAmid this, fans have stood divided over Kohli's call. While some are pondering what led their superstar to miss a series of such magnitude, Kohli has had no lack of support from his peers, Steyn being one of them. The South African great stands right next to Kohli in these challenging times and reckons everything else, including cricket, takes a backseat when it comes to family.\n\nDiscover the thrill of cricket like never before, exclusively on HT. Explore now!\n\n\"Family is your most important priority. Sorry, that's it. That's the end of the story right there. I've got three dogs and when one of them got sick, I was out of the IPL. I was jumping on the plane out of there to come back and see my dog. So that's my family. If Virat Kohli has decided to sit back home because he wants to be with his wife, if he's going to have his second child, I don't see any problem with that. He's been a servant of India for many years. He's won a World Cup; he's captained with success. I don't know what more a man can do to prove himself in the cricketing world,\" Steyn, bowling coach of Sunrisers Eastern Cape, said ahead of the team's SA20 Season 2 final against the Durban Super Giants, told Hindustan Times.\n\nAlso Read: AB de Villiers apologises, makes shocking U-turn on Virat Kohli's second child revelation\n\nThere has been absolutely no movement at Kohli's end. He has been laying low on Instagram, all the more reason why his hugely popular fanbase is worried. People have prayed for his well-being on X, Facebook, Instagram… and you can't really blame them. Even during the birth of his first child, it was a known that he would be returning home after playing the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia, but the fact that he mysteriously disappeared – leaving Hyderabad the same day as he landed – with BCCI dropping a bomb of his withdrawal two days before the start of the 1st Test indicates that things could be a lot more serious than earlier imagined. Don't forget this is the same guy who lost his father and showed up for his team the next day to play a match-saving knock.\n\nThe writing was on the wall though. Last month, Kohli, initially part of India's three-T20I squad against Afghanistan, was again not available for the series opener – the development confirmed to the public on the eve of the match. Prior to it, Kohli had not featured for India in over a month, being rested for the Australia T20Is and the limited-overs led of the South African tour. He made his much-awaited comeback in the two-Test series against the Proteas, looking like a billion dollars and was set to face England before emergency hit. Ever since, it's been all quiet - a report in between stated that Kohli isn't even in the country, apparently London. But in the early hours of Saturday, the BCCI put all the rumours to rest when it announced India's squad for the Rajkot, Ranchi and Dharamsala Tests, and stated 'Virat Kohli will remain unavailable for selection for the remainder of the series due to personal reasons'.\n\n'In such times, cricket doesn't matter'\n\nAt first, Steyn wasn't aware of his former South Africa teammate De Villiers' U-turn, but when he did, the pacer decided not to address him and instead channelled his focus on Kohli. Steyn, de Villiers and Kohli share a close bond – Virat and ABD being as close as brothers. The trio were teammates at the Royal Challengers Bangalore, sharing the locker room for two seasons, which further solidified their bond, and in these testing times, Steyn stands behind Kohli like a rock.\n\n\"I think at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter about cricket. What matters is why you're playing and who helped you get there. The people behind you or behind the scenes, are the ones the public doesn't see. Your partner, your mother, your wife, your sister… those are the people that are constantly picking you up and if it means that their health is in jeopardy or something is wrong with them, you go to them and that's the most important thing,\" pointed out Steyn.\n\nFor those questioning Kohli's decisions and hurling baseless allegations under the guise of 'national duty' – and no true Viratian claiming to be his fan would go to such lengths – the message cannot be more crystal clear. It's none of your business. If cricket is being introduced at the Olympics because of Kohli, that's a national duty he has served. If the ICC Cricketer of the Decade has belonged to Kohli, that's a national duty he has served. If at 30, Kohli was already called a legend, that… is a national duty. And if because of him, more youngsters are finding their calling in cricket around the world, that… is national duty.\n\nKohli is India's icon, but that doesn't mean you're allowed to dissect his life."

Virat Kohli will not play any part in the Test series against England, and Dale Steyn, one of his fiercest rivals on the field, has backed and respected the star India cricketer's decision to be with family. Kohli, expected to miss only the first two Tests, is now out of it entirely, leading to nationwide speculation. After brother Vikas quashed 'false news' around his mother's health being the reason behind Kohli's absence, AB de Villiers' revelation that Kohli was expecting his second child seemed to have answered the burning question. However, with de Villiers retracting yesterday, the suspense meter stands raging hot. On Virat Kohli's absence, Dale Steyn says 'nothing comes above family' (PTI-Getty)\n\nAmid this, fans have stood divided over Kohli's call. While some are pondering what led their superstar to miss a series of such magnitude, Kohli has had no lack of support from his peers, Steyn being one of them. The South African great stands right next to Kohli in these challenging times and reckons everything else, including cricket, takes a backseat when it comes to family.\n\nDiscover the thrill of cricket like never before, exclusively on HT. Explore now!\n\n\"Family is your most important priority. Sorry, that's it. That's the end of the story right there. I've got three dogs and when one of them got sick, I was out of the IPL. I was jumping on the plane out of there to come back and see my dog. So that's my family. If Virat Kohli has decided to sit back home because he wants to be with his wife, if he's going to have his second child, I don't see any problem with that. He's been a servant of India for many years. He's won a World Cup; he's captained with success. I don't know what more a man can do to prove himself in the cricketing world,\" Steyn, bowling coach of Sunrisers Eastern Cape, said ahead of the team's SA20 Season 2 final against the Durban Super Giants, told Hindustan Times.\n\nAlso Read: AB de Villiers apologises, makes shocking U-turn on Virat Kohli's second child revelation\n\nThere has been absolutely no movement at Kohli's end. He has been laying low on Instagram, all the more reason why his hugely popular fanbase is worried. People have prayed for his well-being on X, Facebook, Instagram… and you can't really blame them. Even during the birth of his first child, it was a known that he would be returning home after playing the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia, but the fact that he mysteriously disappeared – leaving Hyderabad the same day as he landed – with BCCI dropping a bomb of his withdrawal two days before the start of the 1st Test indicates that things could be a lot more serious than earlier imagined. Don't forget this is the same guy who lost his father and showed up for his team the next day to play a match-saving knock.\n\nThe writing was on the wall though. Last month, Kohli, initially part of India's three-T20I squad against Afghanistan, was again not available for the series opener – the development confirmed to the public on the eve of the match. Prior to it, Kohli had not featured for India in over a month, being rested for the Australia T20Is and the limited-overs led of the South African tour. He made his much-awaited comeback in the two-Test series against the Proteas, looking like a billion dollars and was set to face England before emergency hit. Ever since, it's been all quiet - a report in between stated that Kohli isn't even in the country, apparently London. But in the early hours of Saturday, the BCCI put all the rumours to rest when it announced India's squad for the Rajkot, Ranchi and Dharamsala Tests, and stated 'Virat Kohli will remain unavailable for selection for the remainder of the series due to personal reasons'.\n\n'In such times, cricket doesn't matter'\n\nAt first, Steyn wasn't aware of his former South Africa teammate De Villiers' U-turn, but when he did, the pacer decided not to address him and instead channelled his focus on Kohli. Steyn, de Villiers and Kohli share a close bond – Virat and ABD being as close as brothers. The trio were teammates at the Royal Challengers Bangalore, sharing the locker room for two seasons, which further solidified their bond, and in these testing times, Steyn stands behind Kohli like a rock.\n\n\"I think at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter about cricket. What matters is why you're playing and who helped you get there. The people behind you or behind the scenes, are the ones the public doesn't see. Your partner, your mother, your wife, your sister… those are the people that are constantly picking you up and if it means that their health is in jeopardy or something is wrong with them, you go to them and that's the most important thing,\" pointed out Steyn.\n\nFor those questioning Kohli's decisions and hurling baseless allegations under the guise of 'national duty' – and no true Viratian claiming to be his fan would go to such lengths – the message cannot be more crystal clear. It's none of your business. If cricket is being introduced at the Olympics because of Kohli, that's a national duty he has served. If the ICC Cricketer of the Decade has belonged to Kohli, that's a national duty he has served. If at 30, Kohli was already called a legend, that… is a national duty. And if because of him, more youngsters are finding their calling in cricket around the world, that… is national duty.\n\nKohli is India's icon, but that doesn't mean you're allowed to dissect his life."

Virat Kohli will not play any part in the Test series against England, and Dale Steyn, one of his fiercest rivals on the field, has backed and respected the star India cricketer's decision to be with family. Kohli, expected to miss only the first two Tests, is now out of it entirely, leading to nationwide speculation. After brother Vikas quashed 'false news' around his mother's health being the reason behind Kohli's absence, AB de Villiers' revelation that Kohli was expecting his second child seemed to have answered the burning question. However, with de Villiers retracting yesterday, the suspense meter stands raging hot. On Virat Kohli's absence, Dale Steyn says 'nothing comes above family' (PTI-Getty)\n\nAmid this, fans have stood divided over Kohli's call. While some are pondering what led their superstar to miss a series of such magnitude, Kohli has had no lack of support from his peers, Steyn being one of them. The South African great stands right next to Kohli in these challenging times and reckons everything else, including cricket, takes a backseat when it comes to family.\n\nDiscover the thrill of cricket like never before, exclusively on HT. Explore now!\n\n\"Family is your most important priority. Sorry, that's it. That's the end of the story right there. I've got three dogs and when one of them got sick, I was out of the IPL. I was jumping on the plane out of there to come back and see my dog. So that's my family. If Virat Kohli has decided to sit back home because he wants to be with his wife, if he's going to have his second child, I don't see any problem with that. He's been a servant of India for many years. He's won a World Cup; he's captained with success. I don't know what more a man can do to prove himself in the cricketing world,\" Steyn, bowling coach of Sunrisers Eastern Cape, said ahead of the team's SA20 Season 2 final against the Durban Super Giants, told Hindustan Times.\n\nAlso Read: AB de Villiers apologises, makes shocking U-turn on Virat Kohli's second child revelation\n\nThere has been absolutely no movement at Kohli's end. He has been laying low on Instagram, all the more reason why his hugely popular fanbase is worried. People have prayed for his well-being on X, Facebook, Instagram… and you can't really blame them. Even during the birth of his first child, it was a known that he would be returning home after playing the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia, but the fact that he mysteriously disappeared – leaving Hyderabad the same day as he landed – with BCCI dropping a bomb of his withdrawal two days before the start of the 1st Test indicates that things could be a lot more serious than earlier imagined. Don't forget this is the same guy who lost his father and showed up for his team the next day to play a match-saving knock.\n\nThe writing was on the wall though. Last month, Kohli, initially part of India's three-T20I squad against Afghanistan, was again not available for the series opener – the development confirmed to the public on the eve of the match. Prior to it, Kohli had not featured for India in over a month, being rested for the Australia T20Is and the limited-overs led of the South African tour. He made his much-awaited comeback in the two-Test series against the Proteas, looking like a billion dollars and was set to face England before emergency hit. Ever since, it's been all quiet - a report in between stated that Kohli isn't even in the country, apparently London. But in the early hours of Saturday, the BCCI put all the rumours to rest when it announced India's squad for the Rajkot, Ranchi and Dharamsala Tests, and stated 'Virat Kohli will remain unavailable for selection for the remainder of the series due to personal reasons'.\n\n'In such times, cricket doesn't matter'\n\nAt first, Steyn wasn't aware of his former South Africa teammate De Villiers' U-turn, but when he did, the pacer decided not to address him and instead channelled his focus on Kohli. Steyn, de Villiers and Kohli share a close bond – Virat and ABD being as close as brothers. The trio were teammates at the Royal Challengers Bangalore, sharing the locker room for two seasons, which further solidified their bond, and in these testing times, Steyn stands behind Kohli like a rock.\n\n\"I think at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter about cricket. What matters is why you're playing and who helped you get there. The people behind you or behind the scenes, are the ones the public doesn't see. Your partner, your mother, your wife, your sister… those are the people that are constantly picking you up and if it means that their health is in jeopardy or something is wrong with them, you go to them and that's the most important thing,\" pointed out Steyn.\n\nFor those questioning Kohli's decisions and hurling baseless allegations under the guise of 'national duty' – and no true Viratian claiming to be his fan would go to such lengths – the message cannot be more crystal clear. It's none of your business. If cricket is being introduced at the Olympics because of Kohli, that's a national duty he has served. If the ICC Cricketer of the Decade has belonged to Kohli, that's a national duty he has served. If at 30, Kohli was already called a legend, that… is a national duty. And if because of him, more youngsters are finding their calling in cricket around the world, that… is national duty.\n\nKohli is India's icon, but that doesn't mean you're allowed to dissect his life."

Senator In Star Wars Doesn't Have A Happy Ending\n\nThe \"Star Wars\" universe is full of thousands of colorful, distinct creatures and characters, with plenty of aliens and other beings that make the galaxy feel bigger and lived-in. Likewise, many of the creatures serve as cool references, like the Zillo Beast being a big homage to Godzilla, or arguably the best reference in the franchise — E.T.\n\nYes, E.T. the titular extra-terrestrial from \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.\" The lovable naked alien has a little role in \"Star Wars: The Phantom Menace\" as a senator seen in the Senate scene when Padmé moves for a vote of no confidence on Chancellor Finis Valorum — an unfortunate moment that allowed Sheev Palpatine to become chancellor and eventually emperor.\n\nIt's a short and sweet reference, one that doesn't imply a larger role and certainly not a tragic fate for the character (officially named Grebleips — more on that later) ... or does it? It turns out Senator Grebleips, who almost appeared in \"Revenge of the Sith,\" met a tragic fate. You see, during the final days of the Clone Wars, Grebleips became more and more involved in galactic politics and crossed paths with some major players. This culminated in Grebleips joining the Delegation of 2000, a group of legislators Padmé helped form that protested Palpatine for his unconstitutional actions — which eventually turned into the Rebel Alliance.\n\nUnfortunately, this was before Palpatine acquired unlimited power and declared himself Emperor. Following Order 66, he dedicated himself to hunting down any and all opponents, including politicians. In issue 84 of Star Wars Insider, a segment of the in-universe HoloNet News tells of how Imperial Intelligence arrested 63 senators on charges of conspiracy and treason for their role in the Jedi rebellion. All 63 senators belonged to the Delegation of 2000, including Grebleips of Brodo Asagi."

Your partner, your mother, your wife, your sister… those are the people that are constantly picking you up and if it means that their health is in jeopardy or something is wrong with them, you go to them and that's the most important thing,\" pointed out Steyn.\n\nFor those questioning Kohli's decisions and hurling baseless allegations under the guise of 'national duty' – and no true Viratian claiming to be his fan would go to such lengths – the message cannot be more crystal clear. It's none of your business. If cricket is being introduced at the Olympics because of Kohli, that's a national duty he has served. If the ICC Cricketer of the Decade has belonged to Kohli, that's a national duty he has served. If at 30, Kohli was already called a legend, that… is a national duty. And if because of him, more youngsters are finding their calling in cricket around the world, that… is national duty.\n\nKohli is India's icon, but that doesn't mean you're allowed to dissect his life."

      "https://indianexpress.com/article/branded-content/best-cat-coaching-in-india-9127689/": "The Common Admission Test, popularly known as the CAT exam, is the largest MBA entrance exam in the country. Approximately 2.88 lakh candidates appeared for CAT 2023 compared to 2.22 lakh in 2022. This number is bound to increase in the upcoming years. To tackle this increasing competition, choosing the right resources and right place to prepare from is a crucial decision in every aspirant’s journey. Going for a coaching institute for your CAT 2024 preparation is not a necessity but it definitely makes your hunt for material easier and provides a mentorship factor. Let us now discuss how to choose the current best CAT Coaching in India.\n\nHow to Choose the Best CAT Coaching in India?\n\nWhile deciding on a coaching institute to prepare for the CAT exam, you need to keep a few things in mind. They are:\n\nResults: The most important factor when it comes to choosing a coaching institute is their track record and ratio of students who cracked the CAT exam against the number of total students who took their classes. Teaching methodology: Understand the coaching institute’s way of approaching concepts. Effective teaching methodologies include interactive classroom sessions, doubt-clearing sessions, and time to time assessment of performance. Faculty: The quality of faculty is of utmost importance. Experienced, knowledgeable and credible teachers who have previously been in your shoes can guide you well through the complexities of the CAT syllabus. Study Material: The study material provided to you by your coaching institute must be up to the latest CAT exam syllabus and pattern. Generic books can be avoided as they have the same old questions which are not even asked in the exam anymore. Focus on Fundamentals : Not all students have the same IQ. Hence, making sure that your coaching institute teaches you from the very basic fundamental concepts and then move on to the advanced level questions. Mock Tests : The coaching institute you’re preparing from must offer a sufficient number of mock tests that simulates the actual exam environment as well as help you with efficient mock analysis. Doubt Solving : When doubts are resolved instantly, students stay actively engaged in the learning process. This promotes a dynamic learning environment where students are encouraged to ask questions, participate in discussions promoting peer to peer learning, and take an active role in their education. Hence, the best CAT coaching in India must take special care of taking up and solving students’ doubts. Class Timings : The class timings must be favourable for all the students. CAT aspirants are generally those who are currently in college pursuing graduation or working professionals. So the class timings must be so that nobody misses the class. Student Feedback and Reviews : Do your research and make sure to go through the reviews and testimonials of past students regarding the faculty and classes before joining a CAT coaching institute. Cost and Value for Money : Evaluate the cost of the course in relation to the value it offers. Consider the overall package, including study material, faculty expertise, and additional support services in addition to the add-ons provided by the coaching institute.\n\nComparing Best CAT Coaching in India\n\nConsidering the current big names in the CAT coaching industry, here is a basic comparison among them all considering all the above mentioned factors.
